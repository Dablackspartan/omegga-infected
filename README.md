# Infected / Zombies (Omegga Plugin)

- Robust minigame creation (tries direct console, API, and Chat.Command).
- Mid-round joiners auto-assigned to Infected (toggle: `mid-join-assign-infected`).
- Survivors convert on death; infected respawn; first infected gets temporary bonus until first blood.
- Optional team tint and sounds; persistent stats via plugin store.
- Blank preset at `plugins/infected/data/blank-minigame.json` you can replace later.
